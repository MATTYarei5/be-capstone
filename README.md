This project is a capstone for the backend development course. It demonstrates the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the semester, including API development, database management, and server-side programming.

This semester, I learned how to design and implement RESTful APIs, manage databases using SQL and SQLAlchamy solutions. I also gained a deeper understanding of authentication and authorization mechanisms.

My favorite part of the class was working on the hands-on projects. These projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, which significantly enhanced my learning experience.
